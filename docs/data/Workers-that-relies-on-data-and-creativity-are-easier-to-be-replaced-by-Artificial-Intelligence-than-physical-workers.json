There is some truth to it and the recent development of ChatGPT and the AI that draws images based on text input shows that the creative workers are not safe from AI.\n\n## How will programmers be affected by AI?\nSeeing how ChatGTP generates text contents like email could make programmers scared. However, there is a huge difference when it comes to the output that programmers create and writers and artists create. It's okay for content writers to have a typo and artists to have a wrong stroke of a brush. It still does not completely ruin the final outcome. However, in case of a software, a single mistake can exposes security holes and generate wrong outputs. Also, there are typically lots of moving parts in a hyper-scale software and not everything can be done using just text contents. \n\nGithub Copilot has been great as it quickly completes my code but it's still my job to ensure that it works correctly. The AI might make code completion more relevant and correct but one cannot be sure that it will work as expected without testing and debugging. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
