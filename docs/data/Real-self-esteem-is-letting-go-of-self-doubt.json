{"title":"Real self-esteem is letting go of self-doubt","content":"# Real self-esteem is letting go of self-doubt\nWhen I start thinking about myself in terms of how I compare to other people or how I would look to other people, I can no longer enjoy or concentrate on the moment. I will start feeling bad and start thinking about what I would have to do to improve my skills or appearances. It doesn’t matter what others would tell me about my skills. I will continue to feel bad until I can convince myself - which most likely won’t happen if I am in fact inferior in certain ways.\n\n[[Strategies for boosting self-esteem should not involve increased self-focus]]. Instead, it should guide kids with low self-esteem to focus on the present moment instead.\n\n---\n* Kid Confidence, Kennedy-Moore\n> The key to breaking free from low self-esteem is to move beyond self-focus. Real self-esteem isn’t about believing we are special or wonderful. Real self-esteem means being able to let go of the question, “Am I good enough?”.\n> Real self-esteem involves developing fully engaged presence in what we are doing right now. When we’re not mentally standing back and judging ourselves, we are free to listen, and learn, and try, and experience, and do, and care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
