{"title":"Use standard deviation instead of average for performance reporting","content":"# Use standard deviation instead of average for performance reporting\nAverage does not provide a full picture of the performance of an application. On the other hand, [[Standard deviation]] can provide more details including the range of dataset and provide useful insights on number of users experiencing the performance. \n\nFor example, an average of 1 second cannot clearly tell what 50% of the users are experiencing. However, 1 second of 50th percentile can clearly tell that 50% of the people would experience 1 second performance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
